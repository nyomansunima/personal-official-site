# This GitHub Actions workflow runs two jobs:
#
# 1. `lint`: Checks the code for linting issues using the Bun runtime.
# 2. `format`: Formats the code using the Bun runtime.
#
# The workflow checks out the code, sets up the Bun environment, and then runs the
# respective linting and formatting commands.
